# About

SNU CardStack is the card game mode and player of SNU. It has a variety of different types of card games, and comes with some unique games. It was inspired by a night with a friend, and also the entirety of my Java class (that's why the games are written in JavaScript, I wanted to come close to Java, but not use Java)
